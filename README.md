# Graphify

Graphs are ubiquitous sctructures in computer science, and are neccesary tools for solving problems in fields ranging from network flow to GPS systems.
However, in C++, a language of choice for many developers, a definitive data type for the graph does not exist. For this reason, this library provides
various necessary prebuilt tools for graphs and graph algorithms.
